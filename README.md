# e621-favorites-downloader
Downloads your favorite things from that umami NSFW furry art site

## Still testing; may or may not work atm

## Set Up
### Mac and Linux
On UNIX/LINUX systems, simply download the `e621-fav-downloads.py` in whatever manner you choose. Chances are that the necessary packages will be installed on your system already.

### Windows (STILL IN PROGRESS)
Windows makes me sad :(

If Windows complains about missing the 'requests' module, open Command Prompt with admin privileges and use the following commands:
```
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
python get-pip.py
pip3 install requests
```
## Usage
